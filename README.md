# PCo
A digital (crypto-like) investment that yields tangible environmental and socio-political projects. 
PCo is simply, distinctly, ingenious for it takes the concepts embedded in financial markets and applies them to appease not only a targeted cohort of customers--or, most naturally termed as segment--but perhaps the entire nation as well through the initiation of uniquely effective environmental and socio-political projects. 
By giving the people something to invest--which can grow exponentially in market capitalization--where such investments will be utilized to not only conceptualize, but most importantly to materialize initiatives that benefit the environment and society, this should be able to hit two most glaring birds with one stone.
